# PROACTIVATE - CS 222 Project

## Introduction:
It is easy for students to miss assignments without having a centralized platform to keep track of all their assignments. Our website will be that platform where students can keep track of assignments and their deadlines, plan out their weeks with to-do lists, and improve study habits using a Pomodoro Timer.

## Application Architecture:
The front-end is responsible for the user interface. It must display a personalized dashboard for the user, Pomodoro Timer, a weekly schedule where users can create To-do lists for each day, and a Deadline Tracker where it keeps track of the weeks/days left before an assignment is due. It must also collect user input, which is sent to the backend.
The back-end is responsible for storing a list of user accounts in the MongoDB database, store a userâ€™s information such as tasks, deadlines, and account information, and send it to the front-end to be displayed. 

## Languages/Libraries Used:
* MERN stack
* MongoDB for database
* React for frontend (Brenda & Divya)
* Node and Express for backend (Parul & Serena)
* Other technologies used:
    * Material UI (for components)
    * Jest (for testing)
    * Firebase (for authentication)

## How to run our program?

To download our code, run the following command in the terminal
```
https://github.com/CS222SP22/course-project-ap-a.git
```

Change directory to "proactivate-web" and run
```
npm start
```

The user would be asked to log into their existing account if not create a new account using an email and password.
Once logged in, the user can see their schedule, deadlines, and account information.
